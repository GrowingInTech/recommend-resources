# Why create this resource?
During my time working for Junjun, he would always have some recommended article or reading.
A lot of the content was relevant for both technical, leadership, managerial, and personal 
growth. 

As beginner and even a seasoned veteran in tech, we sometimes struggle to find what is next.
Therefore, we are compiling a list of resources that can benefit anyone interested in self 
improvement with the help of Junjun, Phasathorn (Lukkid), and myself.
