# Why create this resource?
During my time working for Junjun, he would always have some recommended article or reading.
A lot of the content was relevant for both technical, leadership, managerial, and personal 
growth. 

Not every leader we will have in our careers we be the same and may not provide these resources
and suggestions to their developers, analytics personas, managers, etc. Therefore, I am compiling 
a list of resources that can benefit anyone interested in self improvement with the help of
Junjun, Phasathorn (Lukkid), and myself.
